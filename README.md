# Substance Expressions

Substance Designer Plugin for creating function graphs from code. Includes simple code editor and code generating features

## Installation
Just manually add plugin path to search paths in SD Prefernces:
https://docs.substance3d.com/sddoc/plugin-search-paths-172825000.html
## The Language
The plugin uses Python AST so it's syntactically Python with the expected results. However it supports a very limited featureset of Python, basically just plain arithmetic and logical expressions and function calls.

It looks like this:
```python
# This is one line comment

x = 1.0 # assign float value 1.0 to variable [x]
y = 0.5
pos = get_float2("$pos") # get system variable $pos for pixel processor

sample = samplelum(pos + vector2(x, y), 0, 0) # sample pixel 
```
## Built-in Function Nodes
### Constant
![Constant](https://github.com/igor-elovikov/sd-sex/blob/master/img/constant.png)

All function graph types are supported
```python
# Boolean
a = True
b = False

# Float 
f = 0.0
f2 = float2(1.0, 2.0)
f3 = float3(1.0, 2.0, 3.0)
f4 = float4(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0)

# Integer
i = 2
i2 = int2(1, 2)
i3 = int3(1, 2, 3)
i4 = int4(1, 2, 3, 4)

# String
s = "foo"
```

For vector types all components have to be explicit. So `x = float3(0.0)` won't work, use `x = float3(0.0, 0.0, 0.0)` instead

### Vector
![Vector](https://github.com/igor-elovikov/sd-sex/blob/master/img/vector.png)

Swizzling works differently for integer and float types. Components for float vector are `.xyzw` and for integer `.abcd`
```python
int_vector = int4(1, 2, 3, 4)
i = int_vector.ab # [i] is int2(1,2)
i = int_vector.aaa # [i] is int3(1, 1, 1)
i = int_vector.dbb # [i] is int3(3, 2, 2)

f_vector = float4(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0)
f = f_vector.zyx # [f] is float3(3.0, 2.0, 1.0)
f = f_vector.ww # [f] is float2(4.0, 4.0)

# etc
```
